# Firechirp - Firebase Demo

This repo contains the code that goes along side my talk, Building Fire Apps with Firebase.

You can view my talk at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNz59ciKjOc

## Using the Repo

This project is setup to follow along with the talk. There are TODO comments throughout the project where code related to Firebase is needed.

### Requirements

You will need to create a project in Firebase first, you can do so in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). If you want to deploy to Firebase hosting, you will also need to install the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/).

The project has the `firebase` and `react-firebaseui` packages already installed.

## Live Demo

Link will be provided after the talk.

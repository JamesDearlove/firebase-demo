# Firechirp - Firebase Demo

This repo contains the code that goes along side my talk, Building Fire Apps with Firebase.

You can view my talk at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNz59ciKjOc

## Using the Repo

This project is setup to follow along with the talk. There are TODO comments throughout the project where code related to Firebase is needed. Not all TODO comments are completed in the talk, feel free to complete them for practice.

The [`main`](https://github.com/jamesdearlove/firebase-demo/tree/main) branch contains the skeleton app with no Firebase features added yet.

The [`talk-complete`](https://github.com/JamesDearlove/firebase-demo/tree/talk-complete) branch contains all the code written during the talk. It does not include Firebase keys in the [`firebase.ts`](src/firebase.ts) file.

### Requirements

You will need to create a project in Firebase first, you can do so in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). If you want to deploy to Firebase hosting, you will also need to install the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/).

The project has the `firebase` and `react-firebaseui` packages already installed.
